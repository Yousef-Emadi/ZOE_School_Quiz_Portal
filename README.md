Purpose
The website is intended to be an educational tool where users can have access to flashcards and exams for different school subjects. 
Teachers and students are the target audience. Teachers will be able to create flashcards that will be accessible to students to help them prepare for exams. Teachers will also be able to create multiple choice quizzes to be taken by the students.
